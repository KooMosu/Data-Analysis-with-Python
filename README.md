# Data Analysis with Python

This repository contains a structured set of Python-based data analysis projects,
covering the full workflow from data loading and cleaning to visualization,
exploratory analysis, and statistical inference.

Rather than isolated practice files, the notebooks are organized to reflect
a **progressive learning and application path** in data analysis.

## Repository Structure & Learning Path

### 1. Foundations of Data Analysis
These notebooks focus on building core Python and pandas skills
required for data analysis.

- **Foundations of Python-Based Data Analysis**  
  Basic Python syntax, data structures, and introductory data manipulation.

- **Data Loading and Cleaning in Python**  
  Importing datasets, handling missing values, and preparing data
  for analysis.

---

### 2. Exploratory Analysis & Visualization
These notebooks apply foundational skills to explore real-world-style datasets
and extract descriptive insights.

- **Sales Data Visualization Practice with Python**  
  Visualization of sales patterns using Python, focusing on
  trend identification and categorical comparisons.

### 3. Statistical Inference & Hypothesis Testing
These notebooks demonstrate the application of classical statistical tests
to answer specific analytical questions.

- **Two-Sample t-test: Gender Difference in Sleep Duration**  
  Testing whether average sleep duration differs by gender.

- **One-Way ANOVA: Exercise Frequency Across Academic Years**  
  Comparing mean exercise frequencies across multiple groups.

- **Chi-Square Test: Association Between Breakfast Habit and BMI**  
  Examining the relationship between categorical variables.
