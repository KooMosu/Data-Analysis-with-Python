# Data Analysis with Python

It reflects my interest in applying data-driven decision making to real-world financial and policy problems.

## Tools Used
- pandas
- matplotlib / seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Objective
Analyze credit-related data and build a simple classification model to evaluate financial risk â€” inspired by my work at Korea Technology Finance Corporation.

## Notes
This project is a personal exercise and does not use proprietary data.
