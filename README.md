# Data Analysis with Python  

This repository contains my personal practice project in Python, using real-world datasets related to weather and traffic in Seoul, South Korea.

## Objective

The main goal of this project is to strengthen my hands-on skills in data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and basic modeling by working with public datasets.  
In particular, I explored how traffic volume varies by weather conditions and vehicle types, using real data collected in Seoul throughout 2023–2024.

## Datasets Used

- **Seoul Facilities Corporation – Vehicle Type Traffic Volume Data (2023–2024)**  
- **Korea Meteorological Administration – Daily Weather Data (2023)**

All datasets were publicly available and sourced from open government data portals.

## Tools & Libraries

- Python (via Google Colab)  
- pandas  
- matplotlib / seaborn  
- scikit-learn  

## Key Workflows

- Merging time-series datasets from different sources  
- Handling missing values and standardizing date formats  
- Visualizing traffic and weather trends (daily, seasonal)  
- Exploring relationships between precipitation and vehicle traffic  
- Building a simple classification model to predict traffic conditions

## Background

This project was created as part of my self-directed learning while taking online Python courses.  
Although I come from a non-computer science background, I was motivated to apply what I learned to real data and gain practical experience.  
This analysis also reflects my interest in how data can be used to understand urban systems and inform better decision-making.

## Notes

This is a personal, non-commercial project.  
All data used is publicly available and does not contain any sensitive or proprietary information.
